- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login with session management
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Gotham and Old Stamper fonts
- **Security**: Flask-Talisman, CSRF protection
- **Geolocation**: IP-based geolocation with IPGeolocation API
- **Rate Limiting**: Custom implementation with IP tracking

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- PostgreSQL
- Screen (for running services in the background)
- IPGeolocation API account and key (https://ipgeolocation.io/)

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mikl0s/JAI.git
cd JAI
```

2. Set up the main application:
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment for the main app
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

3. Set up the admin application:
```bash
# Navigate to the admin app directory
cd admin_app

# Create and activate a virtual environment for the admin app
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
cd ..
```

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` in the project root
   - Copy `admin_app/.env.example` to `admin_app/.env.local`
   - Update both files with your PostgreSQL connection details and IPGeolocation API key

5. Database setup:
```bash
# Activate the main app virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the database initialization script
python init_db.py

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

## üö¶ Running the Applications

Use the `services.sh` script to manage both applications:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x services.sh

# For help and available commands
./services.sh --help
```
