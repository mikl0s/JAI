## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- PostgreSQL (running externally)

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mikl0s/JAI.git
cd JAI
```

2. Set up environment variables:
Create `.env` files for both main and admin applications with the following variables:

For main app (`.env`):
```
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DB_NAME=jai_db
DB_USER=jai
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

For admin app (`admin_app/.env`):
```
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_admin_secret_key
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
DB_NAME=jai_db
DB_USER=jai
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

3. Set up virtual environments and install dependencies using the services script:
```bash
./services.sh setup
```

4. Initialize the PostgreSQL database:
```bash
python migrate_to_postgres.py
```

## üö¶ Usage

### Service Management

The project includes a comprehensive `services.sh` script to manage both the main and admin applications:

```bash
# Start both applications
./services.sh start

# Start only the main application
./services.sh start main

# Start only the admin application
./services.sh start admin

# Stop all running applications
./services.sh stop

# Restart all applications
./services.sh restart

# Check status of running applications
./services.sh status

# Set up virtual environments and install dependencies
./services.sh setup

# Display help information
./services.sh help
```

Both applications run in debug mode during development, which enables automatic reloading when code changes are detected.

### Accessing the Applications

- Main interface: `http://localhost:5000`
- Admin panel: `http://localhost:5001`

### Development Workflow

- Database migrations: Use PostgreSQL migration scripts
- Testing: Manual testing through interface and database verification
- Deployment: Ensure proper security configurations and environment variables

  - IP-based tracking
  - Whitelist system
  - Browser fingerprint validation

- **Admin Security**:
  - Session-based authentication
  - IP whitelisting
  - Action logging
  - Geographic tracking
