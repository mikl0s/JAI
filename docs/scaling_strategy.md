# JAI Project Scaling Strategy

This document outlines the scaling strategy for the JAI project, including resource requirements, architecture designs, and cost considerations for different traffic levels.

## Initial Setup

For the initial launch with expected traffic of approximately 10 million views and votes over 30 days:

**Server Specifications:**
- 2 vCPU (Intel Gold 6230)
- 8GB RAM
- 64GB SSD
- Behind Cloudflare for caching and DDoS protection

**Monthly Cost:**
- vCPU: $0.6 × 2 = $1.2
- RAM: $0.2 × 8 = $1.6
- Storage: $0.3 × 2 = $0.6
- **Total: $3.4/month**

This configuration should comfortably handle the expected traffic with room for moderate growth.

## Scaling Approaches

### Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)
- **Implementation:** Increase CPU cores, RAM, and disk space on the single VPS
- **Pros:** Simple to implement, no code changes needed, PostgreSQL works well on larger machines
- **Cons:** Has physical limits, single point of failure, potential downtime during upgrades

### Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)
- **Implementation:** Add multiple application servers behind a load balancer
- **Pros:** Better fault tolerance, theoretically unlimited scaling
- **Cons:** More complex architecture, requires application modifications

## PostgreSQL Scaling Options

### 1. Primary-Replica (Master-Slave)
- **Configuration:** One primary (read-write) and one or more replicas (read-only)
- **Pros:** Simple to set up, good for read-heavy workloads
- **Cons:** No automatic failover without additional tools

### 2. PostgreSQL with Replication Manager (repmgr)
- **Nodes Required:** Minimum 2 nodes, but 3+ recommended for quorum
- **Features:** Automated failover, monitoring
- **Pros:** Adds high availability to standard PostgreSQL

### 3. Patroni + etcd/ZooKeeper/Consul
- **Nodes Required:** 3+ nodes recommended (2 PostgreSQL + 1 consensus)
- **Features:** Robust automated failover, consensus-based leader election
- **Pros:** Industry-standard solution for high availability PostgreSQL

## Viral Growth Architecture

If the website experiences viral growth, the following architecture is recommended for reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness:

```
[Cloudflare] → [Load Balancer] → [App Nodes (2+)] 
                     ↓                   ↓
              [Admin Node]        [PostgreSQL Primary]
                                         ↓
                                 [PostgreSQL Replica]
```

### Detailed Server Specifications

#### 1. Load Balancer
- **Resources:** 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 32GB SSD
- **Monthly Cost:** $0.6 + $0.4 + $0.3 = **$1.30**
- **Software:** HAProxy or Nginx
- **Purpose:** Route traffic, SSL termination, basic caching

#### 2. Application Nodes (Initially 2)
- **Resources per node:** 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 32GB SSD
- **Monthly Cost per node:** $1.2 + $0.8 + $0.3 = **$2.30**
- **Total for 2 nodes:** **$4.60**
- **Scaling Trigger:** Add a new node when CPU utilization consistently exceeds 70%

#### 3. PostgreSQL Primary
- **Resources:** 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 128GB SSD
- **Monthly Cost:** $2.4 + $3.2 + $1.2 = **$6.80**
- **Purpose:** Handle all write operations and critical reads

#### 4. PostgreSQL Replica
- **Resources:** 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD
- **Monthly Cost:** $1.2 + $1.6 + $1.2 = **$4.00**
- **Purpose:** Handle read queries, backup, failover capability

#### 5. Admin Node
- **Resources:** 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 32GB SSD
- **Monthly Cost:** $0.6 + $0.4 + $0.3 = **$1.30**
- **Purpose:** Host admin interface separately for security and stability

**Total Initial Monthly Cost for Viral Setup: $18.00**

## Phased Scaling Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Viral Setup
- Start with the architecture described above
- Implement proper monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana on admin node)
- Set up automated backups for PostgreSQL
- Implement connection pooling (PgBouncer)

### Phase 2: Horizontal Scaling (100K+ daily users)
- Add application nodes as needed (each $2.30/month)
- Implement Redis for session management and caching ($1.30/month)
- Scale PostgreSQL read replicas if read operations become a bottleneck

### Phase 3: Advanced Scaling (1M+ daily users)
- Implement database sharding or consider managed PostgreSQL service
- Add a dedicated caching layer
- Consider containerization for more efficient resource utilization

## Cost Optimization Techniques

1. **Auto-scaling:** Script to automatically add/remove app nodes based on traffic
2. **Resource Monitoring:** Adjust resources based on actual usage patterns
3. **Database Optimization:**
   - Optimize queries and indexes
   - Consider table partitioning for large tables
   - Implement query caching where appropriate
4. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Leverage Cloudflare caching for static assets
   - Implement application-level caching for frequent queries
   - Add Redis for session management when scaling horizontally

## Estimated Costs at Different Traffic Levels

1. **Initial Viral (500K daily users):** $18.00/month
2. **Growing (1M daily users):** $22.60/month (add 2 app nodes)
3. **Highly Viral (5M daily users):** $31.80/month (add 4 more app nodes + Redis)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- CPU utilization across all nodes
- Memory usage and swap activity
- Database connection count and query performance
- Request latency and error rates
- Disk I/O and storage utilization

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Database vacuuming and index maintenance
- Log rotation and analysis
- Security updates and patches
- Database backup verification
- Performance optimization based on collected metrics

## Emergency Procedures

### Database Failover
1. Monitor replication lag between primary and replica
2. If primary fails, promote replica to primary
3. Provision new replica when possible

### Traffic Spikes
1. Ensure Cloudflare is configured to cache static assets
2. Have pre-configured application node images ready for quick deployment
3. Consider implementing a "degraded mode" that can be enabled during extreme traffic

This scaling strategy provides a cost-effective approach to handling viral growth while maintaining reliability and performance. The separation of admin functionality provides security benefits, and the PostgreSQL replica ensures data durability and read scalability.
