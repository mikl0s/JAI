# Future Plans for Judge Voting System

## Lightweight Account System

If spam becomes a significant issue despite our current anti-spam measures, implementing a lightweight account system could provide additional security while maintaining accessibility. This system would:

### Key Features
- Email-based verification (no passwords required)
- One-click login through magic links
- Session persistence through browser storage
- Optional account creation (users can still vote without accounts, but with stricter rate limits)

### Benefits
- More reliable user tracking
- Ability to build reputation over time
- Enhanced spam prevention
- Better voting history tracking
- Potential for community features

### Implementation Considerations
- Keep the signup process minimal (just email)
- Use secure, time-limited magic links for authentication
- Implement progressive enhancement (additional features for account holders)
- Maintain privacy by minimizing collected data
- Allow account deletion with full data removal

### Technical Implementation Details
Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask, handling common tasks like logging in, logging out, and managing user sessions. It's free and integrates directly with Flask.

Flask-Bcrypt offers secure password hashing, which is crucial for user security.

Flask-SQLAlchemy can be used for managing user data in a database, providing a way to store user information securely and efficiently.

Implementation: You can combine these to create a basic but secure user authentication system. Flask-Login manages the session, Flask-Bcrypt secures passwords, and SQLAlchemy handles the database operations.

## Public API for Vote Data Transparency

A public API would enhance transparency and allow for independent analysis of voting patterns while maintaining system integrity.

### Key Features
- Read-only access to aggregated voting data
- Rate-limited endpoints
- Detailed documentation
- Data export capabilities

### Endpoints
- Judge status statistics
- Vote distribution patterns
- Historical voting trends
- Geographic voting distributions
- System health metrics

### Implementation Considerations
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Cache frequently requested data
- Ensure privacy by aggregating data
- Provide clear documentation
- Consider offering different access tiers
- Include authentication for higher-volume access

### Data Access Levels
1. Public (no auth required):
   - Basic judge status counts
   - Overall voting statistics
   - Public judge information

2. Authenticated (API key required):
   - Detailed voting patterns
   - Historical data
   - Geographic distributions
   - Custom queries

### Benefits
- Increases system transparency
- Enables third-party analysis
- Supports academic research
- Builds trust in the platform
